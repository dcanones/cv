	\begin{rSection}{About}
				
		Data Science Leader with a passion for AI and Machine Learning. I've been thriving in the field since 2015, before it was a trending topic. 
		
		My journey started at Servinform, crafting automation solutions that saved significant resources. I further honed my skills at Kernel Analytics and Pragsis Bidoop, focusing on predictive analytics and energy prediction models.
		
		In 2019, I co-founded \href{https://whiteboxml.com}{WhiteBox}, aiming to deliver top-tier Data \& Analytics projects in Spain, the UK, and the US. We've grown significantly, maintaining high-quality standards and attracting top talent. In 2021, we branched out to become one of the first DaaS companies in Spain, launching \href{https://datamarket.es}{DataMarket}, a platform providing quality datasets for our clients.
		
		My goal is to continually innovate, add value through data, and promote technical excellence within my team.
